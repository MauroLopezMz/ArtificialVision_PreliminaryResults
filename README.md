# Visualizing the Grid: Power Quality Classification via Time-Frequency Spectrograms

## Problem Description
The stability of modern electrical power systems is increasingly threatened by Power Quality Disturbances (PQDs) such as voltage sags, swells, harmonics, and high-frequency oscillatory transients. 

## Solution Statement
This project transforms 1D electrical time-series signals into 2D time-frequency spectrograms utilizing the Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT). A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is then deployed to treat the signal analysis as a computer vision problem, extracting spatial features to successfully classify six distinct types of simple and complex grid disturbances.

## Preliminary Advances
In this phase of the activity, the foundational data pipeline and comparative baselines were established. A comprehensive dataset of 18,000 synthetic PQD signals (across 6 classes) was mathematically generated based on IEEE 1159 parameters and successfully transformed into 2D CWT spectrograms. A linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) baseline was trained, which achieved a 90.72% accuracy but demonstrated critical failure in separating non-linear overlapping features (misclassifying transients and sags as "complex" faults). Subsequently, a custom CNN architecture was developed, compiled, and validated on the image dataset, effectively resolving the feature overlap and proving the viability of the deep learning approach.
